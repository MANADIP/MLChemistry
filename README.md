I have 5000 SMILES strings in my dataset. I convert each SMILES string into Molecular Descriptors (such as RDKit Molecular Descriptor, Morgan Descriptor, and Estate Descriptor). Then, I predict various molecular properties such as HOMO-LUMO interaction gap, Dipole Moment, Polarizability, and Solubility by applying different machine learning algorithms.
